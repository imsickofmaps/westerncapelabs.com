### Who We Are
We're a small but feisty team based in Cape Town, South Africa led by Mike Jones - Perpetual starter, jack of all trades!

### What we do
Consulting, development and service creation.

We support the organisation of ScaleConf, the long running and most loved dev conference in Cape Town!

### Who we work with
We're getting quite picky about organisations we work with in our old age. This goes for both customers and suppliers because after all, who wants to hate what they do? 

If you're interested in working with us too then drop us a line.

### Get in touch
Send us an email to hello@westerncapelabs.com or pop in to 139A Forest Drive, Pinelands, Cape Town, South Africa

### Jobs 

We are looking for a software engineer to join our small team in Cape Town.

We are looking for someone who cares about people, particularly the poor and marginalised in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We are looking for someone that values teamwork and collaboration over ego-boosting solo wins.

We are looking for someone that enjoys shipping finished work regularly.

We are looking for someone that believes there’s more to work than the paycheck.

We are looking for someone that likes taking the time to make complex things simple.

We are looking for someone who understands that tests make them a better engineer.

We are looking for someone who has experience (it only needs to be a few years) and enjoys working in Python and JavaScript.

We don’t pay wages as high as the big corporates or international tech companies but we will discuss an appropriate compensation based on your experience and our ability to utilise that experience. We set quarterly goals with our team and offer linked increases based on goal achievement so there is scope for regular growth.

We offer 20 days paid leave per year, plus your birthday if it falls on a work day each year (you’re out of luck if your birthday is Christmas day!).

If you think this sounds like you, or the person you want to be, then please contact jobs@westerncapelabs.com and tell us why we should meet up to take the next step to you joining us on our journey.

Lastly, if you are a recruiter then I’m afraid for now we don’t want to hear from you. We know your life isn’t easy and we’re sorry for excluding you but there’s some great online coding schools, so maybe develop your skills and join us in a few years?
